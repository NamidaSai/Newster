I made this game in 48h for the Ludum Dare 47 Comp game jam. The theme was "Stuck in a Loop."  Whilst brainstorming, the idea kept coming back of interpreting the theme as "Stay in the loop" instead, and soon after came the idea for Newster, a social media simulator. 

When the core mechanics were in place and it was time to write some content, my wife and I made a joke about how it would be funny to have social media but in a fantasy setting, whilst still using current news as "inspiration."  Well, here you have it. 

Enjoy!
